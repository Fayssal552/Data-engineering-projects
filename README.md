## Project 1: End-to-End Streaming Project with Spark, Kafka, and Cassandra

In this project, I have built an end-to-end streaming pipeline using Spark, Kafka, and Cassandra. This project enables the consumption of messages from a Kafka topic, processes the data using Spark, and stores the results in Cassandra

**Services used in this project :** Apache Spark, apache Kafka and apache Cassandra

## Project 3: Snowflake integration with S3


In this project, I have created a data pipeline to import YouTube video data using Snowflake and AWS S3. The pipeline involves setting up a database, schema, storage integration, stage, and table in Snowflake. The YouTube video data, stored in a CSV file, is copied into the Snowflake table for further analysis. This project enables efficient data processing and exploration of YouTube video statistics using Snowflake's powerful analytics capabilities.

**Services used in this project :** Snowflake, S3, IAM
