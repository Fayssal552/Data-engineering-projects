## Project 1: End-to-End Streaming Project with Spark, Kafka, and Cassandra

In this project, I have built an end-to-end streaming pipeline using Spark, Kafka, and Cassandra. This project enables the consumption of messages from a Kafka topic, processes the data using Spark, and stores the results in Cassandra
